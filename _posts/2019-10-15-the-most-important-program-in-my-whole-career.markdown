The most important program in my whole career as a programmer was a [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar).

My eldest daughter couldn't help but laugh when I tried to explain her
the **deep terror** I felt back then. When I faced the WordStar's Tutor
I didn't know English.  

I remember the few words I did understood very clearly "EXPLODE" and "press any key".

I was scared as hell!

Now I see, you laugh too.

I was 11 years old, my precious 286 had been overly expensive for my poor mom.  
And I was going to make it **explode**!

I couldn't conceive that a computer could make fun of a human.

Yet I had no alternative.

So I pressed that fucking key. `Esc` probably.

Yeah, you are still laughing at me. >:-(

That's not funny.   
Ok, it's pretty funny actually... but it wasn't so funny back then.

## I work for YOU!

I coudn't understand much more than this from the last screen: "I work for YOU!". 

That was reassuring. After the pure terror I felt, it was [*cathartic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis).

Since then, breaking hardware and software has been... easy! :-D  
WordStar Tutor teached me to **fear not**.

I wouldn't be a hacker, without it.
