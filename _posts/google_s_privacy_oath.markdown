I don't know who created this little piece of poetry, this wise mantra.

It was brought to me like this, hidden in plain sight, like a gem in a [gorgeous meadow clothed with Pinguiculas](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/).

I don't know if the author was a hacker, a lawyer... or something in between.

But given WHERE (and HOW!!!) he managed to write this wonderful **Privacy Oath**, I don't think Google will be able to **hack back**.
