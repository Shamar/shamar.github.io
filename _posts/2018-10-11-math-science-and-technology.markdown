Recently I've found myself explaining what math and science are a bit too often, so here is a definition.

<dl>
<dt>Mathematics</dt>
<dd>from Greek Μαθημα τικὴ, "the art of learning"<br/>
Mathematics studies the structure of the constructs
of human mind (concepts, patterns, perceptions...) that can be
precisely communicated through language.
</dd>
<dt>Science</dt>
<dd>
The process of forcing the human's perceptions of reality into the structure
of Mathematics, so that it can be shared among humans.
</dd>
<dt>Technology</dt>
<dd>
The process of forcing the human's will into reality, through the creative use of the 
Knowledge acquired by Science.
</dd>
</dl>

Mathematics is a byproduct of human evolution.

But while in these [dark ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) is is used to compete, for 
thousands years Math has been a **tool of human collaboration**.

From such simple definitions, we can infer few amusing lessons:

- Math is not about reality, just about our mind
- It's not Math if it cannot be learned through language: Math move knowledge out of a person mind, turning personal insight into the Culture of Humanity.
- It's not Scince if it cannot described by Math.
- **Science is not about reality**, but about our perceptions of reality: such perceptions are projections of reality into our minds, like shadows.<br/>
  And like shadows a single real object can project several ones: we are forced to say that light behaves like particles AND like waves because neither particles nor waves really exists in reality.
- Technology is Politics: from [wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel) to [sail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sail)
