After my recent article about the legal implications of artificial neural networks, I've got the privilege to share and compare my point of view with a few experts in the field, during my talk at the seminar organized by the “Università degli Studi Milano Bicocca”, in collaboration with “The Innovation Group”.

Of this unexpected and great privilege I've to thank in particular Carlo Batini and Roberto Masiero, that let me know and talk to many smart Professors.

Most of my talk was an application of common sense: behind the hype, the marketing and the cultural (and economical) pressure of lobbies, there is just software, deterministic like any other. Full of bugs, like any other.

However the title of the seminar “Myths and reality of Artificial Intelligence — Theoretical issues and practical developments” and the high preparation of the audience were a call for a more technical contribution than my first article on the topic.

Thus I dared to propose yet another definition of intelligence.
