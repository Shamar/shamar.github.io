Right now United States are facing a **civil war**.

They won't call it this way, obviously, but that's what it is.

After the brutal [murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oejaHE5jUaA)
the protests of the Black community are spreading in the U.S. and rightfully so. 

This civil war will leave deep scars in the people there, many black people will die
and unless they totally destroy the power structure there, unless they destroy the
architecture of their oppression... nothing will really change anyway.

But it's also showing many hypocrisies, injustices and issues that most people and
countries that accepted the American cultural hegemony over the world would prefer
to ignore and forget.

The United States
