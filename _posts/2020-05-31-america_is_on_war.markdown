Right now United States are facing a **civil war**.

They won't call it this way, obviously, but that's what it is.

After the brutal [murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oejaHE5jUaA)
the protests of the Black community are spreading in the U.S. and rightfully so. 

This civil war will leave deep scars in the people there, many black people will die
and unless they totally destroy the power structure there, unless they destroy the
architecture of their oppression... nothing will really change anyway.

But it's also showing many hypocrisies, injustices and issues that most people and
countries that accepted the American cultural hegemony over the world would prefer
to ignore and forget.

The United States are always on war.  
They are built on unfair competition sold as meritocracy and "greatness".  
They are built on a continous **fight for power**, both internally 
(through hate, fear and discrimination) and externally (through 
economical and military imperialism).

Such fight for power takes several forms and occurs on a variety of ground.  
Now it's turning into violence in the streets, and while everybody can 
see how some people on both sides are using this civil war to gain 
visibility and influence, nobody can really predict what will come then.

Right now we can only pray for them.
