Vademecum - Hacker's handbook
=============================

Don't panic! It's funny! ;-)

Being an hacker is all about Curiosity.
Knowledge is just the prize for Curiosity. 
Like Ignorance, it's a fundamental step of an hacker journey. 
It's a destination. And a starting point.

This is just a minimal reference book about hackers' wisdom that you can
use to study and teach our way to the Universe and the Human mind.
You won't find everything. Neither here nor elsewhere.
Here you can only read what you need to know to follow us in your way.

This handbook is organized with a few small introductory texts that
describe the invariant aspects of our culture followed by a pocket
dictionary that provide useful definitions.

The Vademecum itself is a hack to fit a whole Culture in 2^16 byte.

Hackers' Ethics
---------------
Technology is a prosecution of Politics by other means.

Hackers acknowledge this responsibility and want to serve Humanity
through their creative Curiosity. Curiosity is our core value,
what qualify us as hackers. But in our pursuit we also follow other
values such as

1. Freedom: we have the right to learn what we want in the way we want
2. Condivision: the more people know, the more they can learn and share
3. Intellectual Honesty: we can be wrong but not pretend we are not

As complex persons from cultures all over the world, we often have other
values that stem from our beliefs, religion or whatever, but these
values do not conflict with the values above.

Informatics
-----------
While hackers can hack anything, computers and information systems are
our usual environment.

Most hackers are polyglot programmers, master several operating systems,
understand network topologies and properly use cryptography.

Glossary
--------
Computer:
An agent who calculates.
An extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism
by representing computations and without changing a single wire.

Cryptography:
(from κρυπτός γράφειν, "secret writing")
The set of techniques to share secrete messages with one or more person.

Curiosity:
(from cūriōsus, "curious")
The force that moves hackers' action. The will to learn.

Hacker:
A person deeply moved by his own curiosity. Someone who desires
knowledge above all.

Hack:
What hackers do. An experiment. A smart solution to a problem.

Language:
(from lingua, "tongue")
A comunication system among distinct and usually different agents.
E.g. Programming languages are used to control computers.

Man in the Middle (also MitM):
A subversion of users' assumptions by an agent that is able to intercept
(and modify) the contents of the comunications among them, just by
lurking on the path crossed by the messages.

Mathematics:
(from Μαθημα τικὴ, "the art of learning")
The study of the structure of the constructs of human mind (concepts,
patterns, perceptions...) that can be precisely communicated through 
language.

Network:
A group of agents that comunicates.
E.g. A computer network.

Program:
(from programma, "a public notice")
A sequence of instructions that a agent can perform.
E.g. A computer program. A diet program.

Science:
(from scire, "to know")
Science is the process of forcing the human's perceptions of reality 
into the structure described by Mathematics, so that it can be shared
among humans.

Technology:
(from τέχνη λογία, "learning how to build things")
Technology is the process of forcing the human's will onto reality,
through the creative use of the knowledge acquired by Science.
