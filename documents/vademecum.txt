Vademecum - Hacker's handbook
=============================

Don't panic! It's funny! ;-)

Being a hacker is all about Curiosity.
Knowledge, like Ignorance, is a fundamental step of our journey.
They're steps: both destinations and new starting points.

This is just a minimal reference book about hackers' wisdom that you can
use to study and teach our way to the Universe and the Human mind.
You won't find everything. Neither here nor elsewhere.
But here you can read what you need to follow us in your way.

This handbook is organized with a few small introductory texts that
describe the invariant aspects of our culture followed by a pocket
dictionary that provide useful definitions.

The Vademecum itself is a hack to teach a whole Culture in 2^16 byte.


Hackers' Ethics
---------------
Technology is a prosecution of Politics by other means.

Hackers acknowledge this responsibility and serve Humanity through their
creative Curiosity. Curiosity is our core value, what qualify us as
hackers. But in our pursuit we also follow other values such as

1. Freedom: we have the right to learn what we want in the way we want
2. Condivision: the more people know, the more they can learn and share
3. Intellectual Honesty: we can be wrong but not pretend we are not

As complex persons from cultures all over the world, we often have other
values that stem from our beliefs, religion or whatever, but these
values do not conflict with the values above.


Are you an hacker?
------------------
With a strong commitment to the values above, everybody can hack.
More: soon everybody will hack. Just like everybody can write now.

However some people have an innate talent to hack.
Natural hackers are often easy to identify because they often challenge
common assumptions, ask stupid questions and question dumb answers.
Young natural hackers might even look weird to their peers because
they do not share common interests and they have different priorities.
Often they are oblivious to standard social norms such as subordination
to authorities and status symbols.

Such strange behaviour depends on their powerful innate Curiosity that
slowly makes them see the world in a different way. A non conventional
sense of humor and a strong habit to critical thinking are common
expressions of this internal force at work.

If you see yourself into this description, there are good chances that
you are a natural hacker. This doesn't grant you anything. Nobody care.
But you might have a good time hacking and lurking with hackers.


Informatics
-----------
Hackers can hack anything but often computers are our favorite toys.

Several hackers are polyglot programmers, master several operating
systems, understand network topologies and properly use cryptography.
Some venerable hackers also build new hardware devices from scratch.

While hackers have always been present among humans, the term "hacker"
was coined around 1960, in the A.I. department at M.I.T.
mainly because of the peculiar nature of Computers, whose constraints
are pretty different from the physical ones.

When you talk about hacking, most people will think of computers,
while hackers will deduce from context if you are talking about food,
parenting or whatever.

This Vademecum uses Informatics to convey our wisdom. But there's more.


Glossary
--------
As an international movement, hackers are used to adopt the most
widely used lingua franca of their period. In the past, such language
has been Greek, Latin, Arabic, Franch, Chinese (and actually many others
depending on the latitude and age).
After the second World War, the Marshall Plan exported the U.S.A. market
and culture worldwide and English (that was already spoken in several
U.K. colonies) became the usual means of communication among people
of different linguistic backgrounds. This obviously affected science and
tecnology, thanks to the huge U.S.A. investments during the Cold War.
As a product of its times, this Vademecum is in English, but we want to
acknowledge the contribution of all the different cultures that over
the history of mankind stratified into our language.
Thus each term is followed by the known etimology.

Computer:
(Latin: computāre, "calculate")
Who (or what) calculates.
An extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable mechanism
by representing computations and without changing a single wire.

Cryptography:
(Greek: κρυπτός γράφειν, "secret writing")
The set of techniques to share secret messages with one or more persons.

Curiosity:
(Latin: cūriōsus, "curious")
The force that moves hackers' action. The will to learn, to understand.

Hacker:
A person deeply moved by Curiosity. Someone who struggle for knowledge.

Hack:
What hackers do. An experiment. A smart solution to a problem.

Interpreter:
(Latin: interpretor, "I explain" or "I understand")
Someone or something who translate, on the fly, between languages.
A program that executes another program (see Script).

Kludge:
(German: klug, "cleaver", "canny" or "ingenious")
A workaround or quick-and-dirty solution that is clumsy, inelegant,
inefficient, difficult to extend and hard to maintain.

Language:
(Latin: lingua, "tongue")
A comunication system among distinct and usually different agents.
E.g. Programming languages are used to control computers.

Man in the Middle (also MitM):
A subversion of users' assumptions by an agent that is able to intercept
(and modify) the contents of the comunications among them, just by
lurking on the path crossed by the messages.

Mathematics:
(Greek: Μαθημα τικὴ, "the art of learning")
The study of the structure of the constructs of human mind (concepts,
patterns, perceptions...) that can be precisely communicated through 
language.

Network:
A group of agents that comunicates.
E.g. A computer network.

Operating System (also OS):
(Greek: σύστημα, "a whole from parts"; Latin: operārī, "to work")
A set of programs that enable humans to work with a computer.
Such programs provide foundational services to the users such as access
to the underlying hardware through high level abstractions, basic 
security (authentication, authorization, permission control) and often
the possibility to install/execute/control new programs.

Program:
(Latin: programma, "a public notice")
A sequence of instructions that a agent can perform.
As a verb, to write such sequence of instructions.
E.g. A computer program. A diet program.

Science:
(Latin: scire, "to know")
Science is the process of forcing the human's perceptions of reality 
into the structure described by Mathematics, so that it can be shared
among humans.

Script:
(Latin: scrīptum, "anything written")
A human-readable program performed by an interpreter.

Stupid:
(Latin: stupeō, "I'm amazed")
Who surprises. Who challenges our assumptions, forcing us to learn more.
E.g. Holy shit, I cannot answer such a stupid question!

Technology:
(Greek: τέχνη λογία, "learning how to build things")
Technology is the process of forcing the human's will onto reality,
through the creative use of the knowledge acquired by Science. 

User:
(Latin: ūtor, "I use")
A human using a program (as seen from the programmer's perspective).
Users and programmers are humans collaborating asynchronously, even when
both use automated proxies (e.g. the user is scripting the program).
Such collaboration produces a feedback loop in both directions, to the
extent that the programmers can manipulate the users' beliefs and the
user can subvert the programmers assumptions.
Hackers are aware of such collaboration and consider the persons on the
other side in their complexity, beyond the limited scope of the program.
